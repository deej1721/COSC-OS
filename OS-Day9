GENERAL NOTES
  THE MAJORITY OF LOGS WILL BE LOCATED IN /var DIRECTORY
  AUTHENTICATION LOGS:
    /var/log/auth.log - AUTHENTICATION RELATED EVENTS
    /var/run/utmp - USERS CURRENTLY LOGGED IN
    /var/log/wtmp - HISTORY FILE FOR UTMP
    /var/log/btmp - FAILED LOGIN ATTEMPTS
  APPLICATION LOGS:
    apache - WEB SERVER (dir)
    apt - PACKAGE MANAGER (dir)
    /var/log/mysql.log
  SYSTEM - (FIRST OF ALL LOGS GENERATED)
    /var/log/messages - LEGACY CATCH ALL
    /var/log/syslog - UBUNTU/DEBIAN CATCH ALL
    dmesg = DEVICE MESSENGER (QUERIES /proc/kmsg)
    Kernel Ring Buffer - NEVER FILLS
  LOGGING AT A GLANCE
    LOCATION : /var/log
    CONFIG  : /etc/rsyslog.conf
    SERVICE : /usr/sbin/rsyslogd
  LOGGING DAEMON
    /usr/sbin/rsyslogd USER SPACE DAEMON - READS MESSAGES WRITTEN TO /DEV/LOG AND FORMATS AND STORES THEM BASED ON /ETC/RSYSLOG.CONF RULES.
  syslog() VIA libc  - KERNEL RING BUFFER, AUDIT RECORDS VIA AUDIT SUBSYSTEM (audit)
  CONFIG FILE
    /etc/rsyslog.conf LOG ENTRIES FOLLOW SYSLOG FACILITY.SEVERITY STANDARD
      FACILITY = WHAT PROGRAM, OR PART OF SYSTEM, LOG IS FROM, SEVERITY = URGENCY
      CODE  FACILITY
      0     kernel messages 
      1     user-level messages
      2     mail system
      3     system daemons
      4     security/authorization messages
      5     messages made by syslogd
      6     line printer subsystem
      7     network news subsystem
      CODE  SEVERITY
      0     Emergency
      1     Alert
      2     Critical
      3     Error
      4     Warningpretty print
      5     Notice
      6     Informational
      7     Debug
  USEFUL LOGGING COMMANDS
    tail -f - CONTINUOUSLY SHOW END OF FILE
    less /var/log/syslog - VIEW LOG IN PAGE VIEWER
    logger - SEND A USER GENERATED MESSAGE TO SYSTEM LOG I.E. STARTING UPDATE
    > /var/log/messages - WIPES LOGS
    last -f /var/log{wtmp,btmp} - NEEDED TO VIEW DATA FILES
  AUDITING VS LOGGING
    LOGGING IS SYSTEM/APPLICATION DEFINED, WHILE AUDITING IS USER DEFINED
    [kauditd] - RUNS AT THE KERNEL LEVEL AND CAN MONITOR INDIVIDUAL SYSCALLS (/sbin/auditd)
    auditctl - CONTROL/CONFIG CMD
    aureport - SUMMARY REPORTS OF AUDIT LOGS
    ausearch - QUERY AUDIT LOGS
    LOG ROTATION:
      LOG ROTATION ALWAYS REQUIRED - CRITICAL MEMORY SHORTAGES POSSIBLE OTHERWISE, CAN SHUTDOWN EFFECTIVE FUNCTION OF MACHINE 
      /etc/logrotate.conf DETERMINES MAX LOG FILE SIZE AND RETENTION TIME
      LOG FILES CAN BE AUTHENTICATED VIA INODE NUMBERS
    XPATH:
      xpath -q -e '//element/@attribute' file.xml = XPATH SYNTAX

BASELINING THE REGISTRY:
  Determining if the registry has been compromised
  Suspicious behavior
  Potenially malicious application removed from file system, but traces of application keep appearing
  Importance of baselining

REGISTRY HIVES:
  HKCR (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT) - INFORMATION FROM HKLM + HKCU
  HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) - SYMBOLIC LINK OF THE HKU REGISTRY ENTRIES FOR THE USER CURRENTLY LOGGED IN, REMOVED UPON LOGOFF 
  HKLM (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) - READ UPON BOOT!!! ALL HARDWARE CONFIGURATES, SAM, SECURITY, SYSTEM
  HKU  (HKEY_USERS) - REGISTRY CREATES TWO ENTRIES PER USER UPON THEIR LOGIN, ALSO INCLUDES ALL SYSTEM ACCOUNTS, INCLUDES LOTS OF SPECIFICS ON THAT INDIVIDUAL USER
  HKCC (HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG) - SYMBOLIC LINK 

HOW THE HIVES RELATE AND CONNECT:
  HKU -> HKCU

REGISTRY MANIPULATION: 
  QUERY:
    get-childitem GETS ITEMS IN ONE OR MORE SPECIFIED LOCATIONS, MORE OUTPUT
    Get-ItemProperty GETS ITEMS IN ONE OR MORE SPECIFIED LOCATIONS
    Get-Item GETS ONE ITEM IN ONE SPECIFIED LOCATION, DOES NOT RETURN CONTENTS  UNLESS WILDCARD * IS UTILIZED

  MODIFY:
    Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run -Name Test -Value Bacon.exe
      EDITS VALUE OF AN EXISTING SUBKEY
    Remove-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords" -Name "%USERPROFILE%Downloads/test-document.doc"
      REMOVES VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH A SUBKEY

  CREATE:
    New-Item "HKLM:\software\microsoft\officecsp\14.0\security\trusted documents\trustedrecords" -force 
      ADDS A KEY WITHOUT A VALUE

      ADDS A VALUE TO THE KEY JUST CREATED

ALTERNATE DATA STREAM (ADS) NOTES
  ADDING AN ADS TO YOUR FILE DOES NOT CHANGE THE FILE HASH!!! THEREFORE HARDER TO DETECT
  CANNOT BE DISABLED, BUT CAN BE DELETED BY COPYING THE FILE TO A FAT32 FILESYSTEM
  set-content file.txt -value "new stuff" -stream secret.info ADDS A NEW STREAM TO THE FILE
  get-item file.txt -stream * LISTS ALL STREAMS FOR THE FILE
  get-content file.txt -stream secret.info DISPLAYS THE FILE'S CONTENTS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE SPECIFIED STREAM
  !!!IF MORE THAN ONE STREAM EXISTS, THIS MEANS THERE ARE ALTERNATE DATA STREAMS FOR THE FILE!!!

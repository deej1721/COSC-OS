GENERAL NOTES

  AREAS OF INTEREST FOR PERSISTENCE:
    /etc/inittab
    /etc/init.d

  RUNLEVELS:
    0 - HALT [poweroff.target]
    1 - SINGLE USER [rescue.target]
    2 - MULTI USER (NO NETWORKING, NO GUI DESKTOP) [multi-user.target]
    3 - MULTI USER (WITH NETWORKING, NO GUI DESKTOP) [multi-user.target]
    4 - NOT DEFINED, USER DEFINABLE [multi-user.target]
    5 - MULTI USER (WITH NETWORKING AND GUI DESKTOP) [graphical.target]
    6 - REBOOT [reboot.target]
  IF SYSV, USE init #, IF SYSTEMD, USE runlevel#.target -> [index of bracket location above]
  SYSV DIRECTORY: /etc/init.d/rc, SYSTEMD, USE /etc/systemd/system
  IF SERVICE FOUND WITHIN THE DIRECTORIES ABOVE, IT WILL RUN WHEN THAT INIT OR RUNLEVEL IS STARTED OR CALLED IN 
  ls /etc/rdc#.d/ INCLUDES SERVICES AT SPECIFIC RUNLEVELS AND THE LIKE

DEMO NOTES:
  lsblk LISTS MEDIA DEVICES OR STORAGE DEVICES (AS AFOREMENTIONED)
  ssh -J andy.dwyer@10.50.43.196 bombadil@10.4.0.7
  sudo  -u student xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/vda DISPLAYS HEX DUMB OF FIRST 512 BYTES OF THE SPECIFIED DIRECTORY
  dd if=/dev/vda of=MBRcopy bs=512 count=1 
    xxd IS FOR HEX DUMP
    dd IS IS FOR BIT-TO-BIT COPIES
